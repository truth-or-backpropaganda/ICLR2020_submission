# Truth or backpropaganda? An empirical investigation of deep learning theory (https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxyIgHFvr)
### ICLR2020_submission

This repository consists of code developed in order to explore empirically certain assertions about deep learning. Specifically, experiments in this repository examine local minimia in the loss surface, weight decay, neural tangent kernals, and the rank of operators in networks. The directories in this repository are separated by topic.
